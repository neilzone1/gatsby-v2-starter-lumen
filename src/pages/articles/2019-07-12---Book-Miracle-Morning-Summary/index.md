I listened to the audiobook of this, but took a lot from it in the final part of our trip round Australia.

## Takeaways
- 95% of people settle in life, they accept mediocre and average, they get to the end regretting what they’ve done, or what they haven’t.
- To excel above "average" people, you have to do something different.
- Having a personal mission and values will help and provide a deeper level of motivation.

## The snooze proof wake up routine
Think positively about the amount of sleep, no matter what - you don’t need as much as you think, and your last thought before going to sleep often sets the tone for the mood when you wake up.

### Snoozing is losing. 
Essentially it’s taking an activity you hate doing (getting up) and making you have to go through it multiple times.

> If you really think about it, hitting the snooze button in the morning doesn’t even make sense. It’s like saying ‘I hate getting up in the morning, so I do it over, and over, and over again.’

Now Australia time difference is out of the way, it’ll be more straightforward.

### Snooze-proof your wake up
- Get a glass of water for the morning
- Set your intentions before bed
- Bedtime affirmations
- Move the alarm across the room
- Wake up, brush teeth straightaway
- Down a glass or water
- Get dressed to exercise
- Jump in the shower

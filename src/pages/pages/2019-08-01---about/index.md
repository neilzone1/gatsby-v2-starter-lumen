Hello there, I'm Neil - thanks for visiting my site.

My passions are technology, helping people and embracing adventure.  This ties into my mission - to live honestly, help others and make the most of the opportunity.

It's important to me to do this in all aspects of my life, whether at home with the family, at work, or volunteering in the community.  I find this helps me stay authentic, upbeat and allows me to approach challenges with energy and open-mindedness.

## Career
I'm part of the team at Semantic - a [friendly digital agency in the UK](https://www.semantic.co.uk).  Semantic was founded in 1997, and I joined in 2008, so it's been a big part of my life.  I was lucky to work my way up, under the careful guidance of Nick Warren, the previous owner and still a great friend of mine.  His support combined with my constant desire to take on more responsibilities and improve things helped me to work to become Managing Director in March 2016.  

Whilst on the surface it seems that Semantic develops websites, it's actually all about developing people.  I was fortunate to be able to buy the business in 2018, and I'm working hard to make the most of the opportunity, keep the team happy and deliver awesome results for our clients.

## Turning 30
Looking back, I've really learnt a lot in the few years since hitting this milestone.  It's amazing to be alive at this moment in history, with so much information and thinking available at the touch of a button online, but I have found this to be a blessing and a curse at times.  

In my twenties, I was fast and impatient - for instance, I used to power through as many audiobooks as possible to try and hoover up all of the knowledge.  

Now, I have developed better processes to think things through in more detail, and to be mindful of goals and desired results. 

Some of the stand-out lessons that have really stuck in my mind over the past few years are: 
* 'Start with the end in mind' - Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly Successful People
* 'Nothing is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so' - a Shakespeare quote in Hamlet, all to do with Stoicism, and echoed in various books by Ryan Holiday and Derren Brown
* 'Eat That Frog' - Brain Tracy's classic book to tackle the hard problems first
* 95% of people settle with average, so if you want to be above that, you can't do the same stuff as everyone else - Hal Elrod's Miracle morning
* I really like the Chimp Paradox book by Steve Peters - having such a strong reminder about the unique human ability to separate our thinking from our responses/behaviour is a valuable lesson when dealing with other people and situations.
* Factfulness by Hans Rosling is a must read if you want a data-driven perspective on the world and how it's developing.
* The live shows from Derren Brown that I've seen are mind-blowing - it's scary/exciting how easy it is to trick the brain, and how similar everyone is on the inside.

The biggest highlight of all (outside of starting a family), was during our long trip round Australia.  Getting some headspace to think about my mission and tying everything together was so helpful.  I even spent a morning writing my own eulogy - not your typical holiday activity, but  

## Other interests
I'm careful to make sure all Semantians have a really good work-life balance.  I think it's so important and really helps people to do their best work.  For me, that means spending time getting out there and enjoying the world: 
* Travel and adventure (especially with our 9 month old daughter around Australia!) 
* Cycling
* Reading and audiobooks (particularly books around growth, psychology, philosophy and stoicism)
* Badminton
* Piano
* Swimming and swimming coaching
* Walking in the woods 
(so important for clearing your head)
